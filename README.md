# AWS-SERVERLESS-DEPLOYMENT
Devops Master Project1
☁️ AWS Serverless Deployment

DevOps Master Project 1

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a serverless application deployment on AWS, showcasing how to build and run applications without managing servers. The solution leverages AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3 to create a cost-effective, scalable, and event-driven architecture.

🎯 Purpose

Deploy a serverless application using AWS native services.

Automate infrastructure setup with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Highlight best practices for scalability, monitoring, and cost optimization.

🛠️ Tech Stack

AWS Services: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFormation

Languages: Python (for Lambda functions)

DevOps Tools: AWS CLI, CloudFormation (IaC), GitHub

Environment: AWS Cloud

📂 Architecture

S3 – Static content storage & hosting.

API Gateway – REST API endpoint for client interactions.

AWS Lambda – Serverless compute to process API requests.

DynamoDB – NoSQL database for persistent storage.

CloudFormation – Automates provisioning of infrastructure.

🚀 Deployment Steps

Clone repository and configure AWS CLI.

Deploy infrastructure with CloudFormation template.

Upload static assets to S3 bucket.

Deploy and test Lambda functions behind API Gateway.

Validate integration with DynamoDB for data persistence.

📊 Results

Fully serverless application deployed on AWS.

Scalable, event-driven architecture without provisioning servers.

Demonstrated cost efficiency by using pay-per-use services.

Infrastructure automated via CloudFormation for repeatability.

✅ Key Takeaways

Serverless = less ops, more focus on business logic.

IaC (CloudFormation) ensures repeatable, version-controlled deployments.

DynamoDB + Lambda enable near real-time, low-latency applications.
